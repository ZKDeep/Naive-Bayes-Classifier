# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
A naive Bayes classifier estimates the class-conditional probability by assuming that the attributes are conditionally independent./n 
We have used M-estimate of Conditional probability /n
Continouse attributes are assume a certain form of distribution. Gussian distribution is choosen and probability is found using equation 5.16 (book: Introduction to Data Mining by PANG-NING TAN et al. page no:231)/n

# How to run the code
The code is given with two csv data sets of vertibrates and bandata. /n
You can pass you own data and predict the test record using main.py /n
Steps to include your own data set is explained well under comments in main.py /n
# Thank you.
