# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
A naive Bayes classifier estimates the class-conditional probability by assuming that the attributes are conditionally independent.\ 
We have used M-estimate of Conditional probability \
Continouse attributes are assume a certain form of distribution. Gussian distribution is choosen and probability is found using equation 5.16 (book: Introduction to Data Mining by PANG-NING TAN et al. page no:231)\

# How to run the code
1. Code is given with two csv data sets of vertibrates and bandata. \
2. You can pass your own data and predict the test record using main.py \
3. Use model.py for changes in model of Naive-Bayes-Classifier. \
4. Steps to include your own data set is explained well under comments in main.py \
# Thank you.
